23h2 Baseline

The 23h2 Intune Baseline from Microsoft contains the complete Baseline but as Config Profile instead of a Security Baseline
the Settings are like for like and should give a reasonably high standard of Security to a Windows Workstation

Baseline updated 13th April 2024 with Support for non English OS's
